Assignment 2-2 Essays

Input/Output Description: The input is stored in the celsius variable and asks the user for the temperature in Celsius. It is also converted into an integer using the int() function.

Explanation of All Variables: The variable celsius stores the integer value of the user’s temperature input in Celsius. The variable fahrenheit converts the user’s input of the temperature in Celsius to the temperature in Fahrenheit using the equation provided.

Flow chart is in the github repository.

Errors and Lessons: I did not face many errors on this assignment as there was minimal coding required. However, I was able to practice using f-strings and the format function and I got to use the equation to convert temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit in python which is something that I don’t remember doing before.
